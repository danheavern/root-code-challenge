## TypeScript and Jest
I chose to complete this problem using TypeScript because it is a language I can quickly write and iterate in, and I have a good understanding of the style rules and idioms which will best demonstrate my ability.  Additionally, I believe having strongly typed data helps reinforce deliberate and precise code.  

I decided to use Jest to implement the test cases for this project for similar reasons; Jest is a common testing framework and one that I'm familiar with and will allow  me to quickly build out test cases without friction.  Other benefits of using Jest are that it works well with TypeScript, and can generate a coverage report.
